> Below are the files introduced in each week and used in each week
> of the course. See file for description...

### Orientation:

Before you get started, please refer to this article: [Orientation to the Starter Code, Data Files and Front-end](https://github.com/LLancelot/UCSDGraphs/blob/master/Orientation%20to%20the%20Starter%20Code%2C%20Data%20Files%20and%20Front-end.md#orientation-to-the-starter-code-data-files-and-front-end)

### Week 1 & 2 : Introduction to the course and graphs

- ```basicgraph.Graph.java```

- ```basicgraph.GraphAdjList.java```

- ```basicgraph.GraphAdjMatrix.java```

### Week 3 : Class design and simple graph search

- ```roadgraph.MapGraph.java``` (Implemented methods in this file and run it on searchGrader.java for testing)

- ```week2example.Maze.java```

- ```week2example.MazeLoader.java```

- ```week2example.MazeNode.java```

### Week 4 : Finding shortest paths in weighted graphs

- ```roadgraph.MapGraph.java``` (Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm and A* search)
- ```roadgraph.MapNode.java``` (Modified some variables)
- ```roadgraph.MapEdge.java```

### Week 5: Route planning and NP-hard graph problems

- Produce the solution to the TSP for a given graph.
- Analyze whether an algorithm optimally solves the TSP
- Analyze the running time for TSP algorithms
- Explain the notion of an NP-Hard problem
- Differentiate between Hamiltonian and Eulerian graphs.
- Describe how a heuristic solution compares to an optimal solution

### Week 6: End of Course Project Extension

- Design an extension to your project.
- Develop your extension to your project.

----------------------

### Utility files

- ```geography.GeographicPoint.java```

- ```geography.RoadSegment.java```

- ```util.GraphLoader.java```

### Importing Project into eclipse:

	1. Create a new Java Project in your workspace
	2. Import the starter files:
	  File -> Import -> Select "File System" -> Next -> Browse and set 
	  root directory to folder contents of zip were extracted to -> Finish

Feel free to use another IDE or manually compile and run your programs.
If you need help, google is your friend.
